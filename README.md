This is the code repository for the paper:

Representation Learning for Object Detection from Unlabeled Point Cloud Sequences.
Xiangru Huang, Yue Wang, Vitor Guizilini, Rares Ambrus, Adrien Gaidon and Justin Solomon.
Conference on Robotic Learning (CoRL) 2022. 

The code is adapted from [OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet). The code will be updated by September 5th to include full functionality. Currently, it can extract object cluster sequences from LiDAR point cloud sequences for Waymo Open Dataset.

# System Requirements

The code has been tested with the following (major) environment dependencies:
```
waymo-open-dataset-tf-2-5-0==1.4.3
torch==1.13.1+cu117
```

# Installation
